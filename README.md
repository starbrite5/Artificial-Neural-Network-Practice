# Artificial Neural Network Practice
Artificial Neural Network Practice with 3D Sinusoidal Data.
The main purpose of this assignment was to gain experience using artificial neural networks to solve simple regression problems. In this assignment, I fit a neural network to a noisy 3D sinusoidal data set.
